// Implementations must honour three rules, each of which exists because

//
//   - Run the operation at least once.
//
//   - On failure return the zero T, never the last attempt's value. Handing
//     back a partially built value alongside an error invites callers who check
//     the error loosely to use a half-open connection.
//
//   - On failure return a *domain.InitError whose Reason comes from the
//     policy's own stop condition, never inferred from the operation's error.
//     A policy that classifies by inspecting the operation error reports a
//     timeout for an operation that returned context.DeadlineExceeded on every
//     attempt, when what actually happened is that the retry budget ran out.
